# Fonts

This directory contains the font files for the ViralSplit mobile app.

For now, we'll use system fonts. Custom fonts will be added later.

To add custom fonts:
1. Download Inter font family from Google Fonts
2. Place the font files (TTF/OTF) in this directory
3. Update the font loading in App.tsx
